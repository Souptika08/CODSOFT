# Iris Flower Classification

This is a machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species:  
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

The classification is based on four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

A Logistic Regression model is trained every time the program runs, and it predicts the species based on user input.
